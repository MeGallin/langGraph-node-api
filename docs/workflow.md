# 📄 Workflow.md — Migration Plan for FlowiseAI to Node.js/LangGraph

## 🧠 Flow Structure (Based on Uploaded Flowise JSON)

| Node         | Description                                               |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Start Node** | Initializes conversation flow, links to model, memory, and state. |
| **Agent Node (Sequential Agent)** | Agent that uses a system prompt to introduce itself and ask for user name. |
| **End Node**  | Marks the end of the agent sequence. |
| **ChatOpenAI Node** | Provides a GPT-4o-mini model instance for the agent. |
| **SQLite Agent Memory Node** | Provides persistent memory (conversation state) using SQLite. |
| **State Node** | Custom conversation state configuration. |

---

## 🏗 Key Observations

- 🛠 **Model:** OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini).
- 🛠 **Memory:** SQLite database for persistent memory.
- 🛠 **Custom State:** Centralized messaging and state management.
- 🛠 **Sequential Execution:** Start → Agent → End (with memory/state updates).
- 🛠 **Approval-Ready:** Ability to request user approval before tool invocation (optional).

## 🧩 LangGraph Rebuild Plan

| Flowise Node         | LangGraph Node Equivalent   | LangChain/LangGraph Component        |
|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Start                | StartNode (Initialize State) | LangGraph StartNode                  |
| Agent (seqAgent)     | Sequential Agent Node        | LangGraph Node (LLM + Tools)         |
| End                  | EndNode                      | LangGraph EndNode                    |
| ChatOpenAI Model     | ChatOpenAI()                  | LangChain LLM wrapper                |
| SQLite Memory        | Custom LangChain memory      | SQLite persistent memory             |
| State                | LangGraph State Configuration | Pass state between nodes             |

## 📚 Migration Steps

1. **SQLite Memory**: Create a LangChain-compatible SQLite-based memory handler.
2. **LLM Setup**: Configure ChatOpenAI model instance.
3. **State Management**: Define LangGraph state object.
4. **Graph Nodes**: Build LangGraph nodes:
   - Start Node (Initialize model, memory, state)
   - Agent Node (Sequential agent logic)
   - End Node (Terminate flow)
5. **Service Layer**: Wire into Express.js `agentService.js` for API usage.

## 🚀 Next Actions

**Option 1:** Quickly implement the full Node.js + LangGraph application skeleton.  
**Option 2:** Step-by-step implementation: StartNode, AgentNode, EndNode reviewed individually.

# ✅ Notes

- Focus on preserving agent behavior as per Flowise flow.
- Use LangGraph for all sequential multi-agent interactions.
- Ready for production-grade scaling and containerization.
